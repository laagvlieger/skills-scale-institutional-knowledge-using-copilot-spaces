# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

## Overview

OctoAcme's project management framework enables cross-functional, iterative delivery with strong stakeholder alignment and robust quality assurance. Each project follows a structured lifecycle: Initiation, Planning, Execution, Release, and Closure. The framework centers around five foundational principles:

- **Customer-first delivery:** Projects prioritize customer value and usability across all phases.
- **Iterative, incremental releases:** Deliver shippable increments with clear acceptance criteria, enabling rapid feedback and adjustments.
- **Clear ownership:** Every phase is anchored by named Project Managers and Product Leads.
- **Data-informed decisions:** Impact, velocity, and success metrics are tracked and actioned.
- **Psychological safety:** Encourage transparent communication, feedback, and blameless retrospectives.

### Project Lifecycle & Workflows

Projects start with a validated business need and a Project One-pager, then progress through phase-gated planning, daily execution, and systematic release. Key workflows include prioritized backlogs, release timelines, project boards (Backlog → Ready → In Progress → In Review → QA → Done), and small, reviewable PRs. Communication is guided by daily standups, weekly syncs, monthly stakeholder updates, and a clear escalation path for risks and blockers. Quality assurance is embedded via automated testing, manual QA, and a risk register with continuous monitoring.

### Roles & Communication Structure

Four roles form the backbone of project execution: Project Managers (scheduling, risk, communication), Product Managers (outcome definition, backlog, metrics), Developers (features and tests), and QA/Testing. Communication is structured and transparent, ensuring risks are managed quickly and learnings are fed back into documentation and process improvements.

### Continuous Improvement

After each milestone or incident, OctoAcme teams hold retrospectives and prioritize actionable improvements—closing feedback loops and accelerating onboarding. All process knowledge is versioned, discoverable, and centralized in this Copilot Space.
